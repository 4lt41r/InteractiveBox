I would be Honest, last Html code i manually have written was 4 years back while i used to play arround with html and css , and i was also doing a udemy course on front end web development, This is basic even though i know what this code does and i can troubleshoot it. but the code was generated by chatgpt and some thing it failed to follow through but i tweaked the code to make it look closer to the Figma design. i can tell you only this, i am a tech savy person i have lost touch with html and css but basic syntax i am aware of and i am sure if i implement it on daily basis i will catch up extremely fast. i have attached we resume as well , when i started making webresume it was basically manual code few years back and i was the one who wrote each code in that resume , but the current one i have shared was updated version which i generated with the chatgpt and tweaked as again it didnt follow through the entire instructions. you can choose to take a gamble on me or not. but i was fun learning something new again have a great day.
